# Portfolio Future Enhancements & New Section Ideas

This document outlines potential sections and features to add to the portfolio to increase engagement, professionalism, and uniqueness.

## 1. Professional Credibility Sections

### **Process / Work Methodology**
*   **Why**: Shows *how* you solve problems, not just the result.
*   **Content**: Steps like "Discovery -> Design -> Development -> Testing -> Deployment".
*   **Design**: A timeline or horizontal stepper visualization.

## 3. Engagement & Interaction

## 4. "Humanizing" Sections

### **Volunteering & Community**
